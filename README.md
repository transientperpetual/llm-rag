# wisdom-compass (llm-powered)

This repository is designed to train a language model as a personal assistant, embodying the philosophy I've cultivated over the years through learnings from books, articles, schools of thought, and personal reflections. To enhance decision-making speed and save time.

## Inspiration

Inspired by the belief that philosophy is not just an academic pursuit but a practical guide to living contentfully, this repository is a testament to the power of continuous learning and self-discovery.
